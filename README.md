# Mobile Cross Platform Library

### Motivation
When building a modern product, it is common to have a client for the web, iOS and Android. This is a repository to experiment with developing a cross-platform library (single codebase) that could be used by apps written for iOS, Android and possible web clients. This will eliminate business rules and logic that needs to be implemented across multiple clients.
